This is the repository containing source code for a basic HTML web site, and is intended to be used in conjunction with the Introduction to Git video tutorial on The Unit Learning web site.

## *_NOTE:_*
This is not the original archive used by the author of the tutorial, so there are some differences. The difference in file names and file content is really not important for this tutorial. All of the steps and tasks in the tutorial can be achieved with this repository.

This content has been produced specifically for The Unit, Grafton.
